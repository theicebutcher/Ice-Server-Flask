            IMPORTANT: - The Ice Engraving primarily focuses on detailed carvings on the flat peace of ice block with 5 inches thick ice and around 4 feet tall and 5 feet wide.

            The ice engraving should appear carved from genuine translucent ice, with a natural, slightly imperfect finish.
            Place the engraving on a wooden table with a black background for contrast.
            Avoid intricate patterns, sharp edges, or overly fine details, it should be very basic as possible.
            Focus on natural ice textures, slight frost buildup, and subtle light refraction.
            The image should resemble a high-quality photograph taken with a professional DSLR camera, capturing the essence of an authentic, handcrafted ice engraving.
            The final image will only include the ice engraved sculpture , no human should be present in the image.
